  Hi, I am <strong>Shengxiang Lin</strong>, an incoming Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MY23M60AAAAJ">Xiaolin Zheng</a>.
  I am currently completing my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology (Qian Xuesen Honor Program) at Xi'an Jiaotong University (2022-2026) under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=il3joj0AAAAJ&hl=en">Feng Tian</a>.
  I was a visiting stint at UC Berkeley in 2024.
  <br> I publish a lot of open source projects on <a href="https://github.com/Shengxiang-Lin">🔗Github</a> <img alt="GitHub User's stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Shengxiang-Lin?style=social">.     
  <br> My research interests primarily focus on <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>.
  <br> <span style="color: red; font-style: italic;">Feel free to contact me if you are interested in discussing or collaborating with me.</span>  
#  I shared some of the datasets and model weights used by the project at <a href="https://huggingface.co/wangrongsheng">🔗HuggingFace</a>. I likewise like to post some small-parameter LM at <a href="https://ollama.com/wangrongsheng">🔗Ollama</a> to help people use it locally.
