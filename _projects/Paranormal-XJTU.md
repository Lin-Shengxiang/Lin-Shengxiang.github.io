description: "Based on XJTU's century-old history, this project transforms historical campus buildings and legends into core game narrative elements, achieving deep integration between campus culture and game content. Artistically, it employs customized pixel-art maps that fully cover the main Xingqing campus. Technically, it features a dynamically developed real-time character tracking system for automated scene transitions and a self-developed interaction engine that supports multi-character movement—including walking, running, and interactive actions—along with seamless scene rendering."
